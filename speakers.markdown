    </summary>
    Jonathan Frankle is Chief Scientist (Neural Networks) at Databricks, where he leads the research team toward the goal of developing more efficient algorithms for training neural networks. He arrived via Databricks’ $1.3B acquisition of MosaicML, where he was part of the founding team. He recently completed his PhD at MIT, where he empirically studied deep learning with Prof. Michael Carbin, specifically the properties of sparse networks that allow them to train effectively (his "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis" - ICLR 2019 Best Paper). In addition to his technical work, he is actively involved in policymaking around artificial intelligence. He earned his BSE and MSE in computer science at Princeton and has previously spent time at Google Brain and Facebook AI Research as an intern and Georgetown Law as an Adjunct Professor of Law.

    <b>Mohammad Shoeybi</b> <br /><em>NVIDIA</em>
    </summary>
    Dr. Mohammad Shoeybi is the Director of Applied Research at NVIDIA. His team focuses on building large foundational models and improving them to downstream applications. His team has build Megatron-LM, a framework for efficiently training LLMs and used it to train several large scale models such as Megatron-Turing NLG with 530 billions of parameters. He received his PhD. from Stanford University in 2010. Prior to NVIDIA, he worked at DeepMind and Baidu USA leading efforts on bringing deep learning and reinforcement learning to applications.
    <!-- Bryan Catanzaro leads a team finding new ways to use AI to improve projects ranging from
language understanding to computer graphics and chip design. He is pioneering the training of LMs
at scale, including through the Megatron project. Bryan’s research at NVIDIA led to the creation of
cuDNN, and more recently, he helped to lead the team that invented DLSS 2.0. <br /> -->
