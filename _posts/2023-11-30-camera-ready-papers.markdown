We are excited to share that camera-ready version of accepted papers have been uploaded to [WANT page at OpenreView](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2023/Workshop/WANT)! We got 50+ submissions that were reviewed by 80+ Reviewers, 6 Area Chairs, and Program Chairs. Many thanks to all contributed Authors and [Program Committee](https://want-ai-hpc.github.io/neurips2023/organizers) for making the training of neural networks more efficient!
