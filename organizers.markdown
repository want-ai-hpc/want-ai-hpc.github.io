## Julia Gusak

[Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QriHoq4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) [Website](https://juliagusak.github.io/about/)

 <!-- (Researcher at Inria, University of Bordeaux; yulia.gusak@inria.fr; publications). -->
Julia is a Research Scientist at Topal (HiePACs) team at Inria Bordeaux. She got her Master’s in
Mathematics and Ph.D. in Probability Theory and Statistics from Lomonosov MSU in parallel with
Master’s in Computer Science and Data Analysis from Yandex School of Data Analysis. Before
joining Inria she worked Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology. She has conducted research
and developed software to optimize inference and training of neural networks (e.g., by applying
approximation techniques such as tensor/matrix methods and quantization). Her recent research
is devoted to memory-saving and parallelization techniques for large model training. She serves
as a reviewer at conferences (ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AISTATS, IPDPS) and in journals. Julia
organized and moderated the Chess and AI meetup, which took place at the venue of FIDE World
Cup 2021 in the hybrid (online+offline) format.

## Jean Kossaifi

<!-- (Senior Researcher at NVIDIA; jkossaifi@nvidia.com; publications).  -->
Jean Kossaifi is a Senior Research Scientist at NVIDIA. Prior to this, he was a Research Scientist at the
Samsung AI Center in Cambridge. His current focus is on neural operators and tensor methods
for machine learning. Particularly, efficient combination of these methods with deep learning
to develop better models that are also memory and computation efficient. He is the creator of
TensorLy, a high-level API for tensor methods and deep tensorized neural networks in Python,
designed to make tensor learning simple and accessible. Jean received his Ph.D. and MSc from
Imperial College London, where he worked with Prof. Maja Pantic. He also holds a French
Engineering Diploma / MSc in Applied Mathematics, Computing, and Finance and obtained a BSc
in advanced mathematics in parallel. Jean was a co-organizer of multiple workshops and tutorials,
including the CVPR 2019 tutorial on Cause-and-effect in a Tensor Framework and ICCV 2017
workshop on Matrix and Tensor Factorization Methods for Computer Vision. He was an invited
speaker to several workshops and a reviewer and area chair for top conferences, including NeurIPS
and ICML.

## Alena Shilova

<!-- (PostDoc at Inria Lille, Scool team; Alena.Shilova@inria.fr; publications) -->
Alena is a PostDoc at Inria Lille in Scool team. She got a Master Degree in Data Science and Applied Mathematics and did a PhD at the Topal
team of Inria Bordeaux from 2018 to 2021. During her PhD she studied how to perform memory-
efficient training of neural networks, which includes works on re-materialization, offloading and
pipelining, the results of which were published in world-class conferences and journals. Alena
was also teaching AI-related classes such as Tools for Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data
Analysis to master students in Enseirb-Matmeca. She was an invited speaker to several workshops
on the similar topics and she had an experience of chairing Distributed Learning Algorithms session
at ICPP 2022.

Cristiana Bentes obtained her D.Sc. in Systems Engineering and
Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1998, where she took
part of the group which developed the first Brazilian parallel computer. She is currently a Full
Professor in the Department of Systems Engineering and Computer Science at State University of
Rio de Janeiro. She is currently Associate Editor of JPDC and FGCS. She was Guest Editor of CCPE
(2017), IJGUC (2018) and IJHPCA (2018). She has been member of the Program Committees of
many conferences, such as Supercomputing (2014, 2020, 2022 and 2023), IEEE Cluster (2020,
2021, 2022, 2023), SBAC-PAD (2018, 2019, 2020), VECPAR (2016, 2018) and HiPC (2023). She
was the Program Chair of IEEE International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High-Performance Computing 2021 (SBAC-PAD) and general chair of SBAC-PAD in 2023. She is also
the chair of the workshops: Workshop on Parallel Programming Models at IPDPS and Workshop
on Applications for Multi-Core Architectures at SBAC-PAD. Her current research interests include
High-performance Computing, Parallel Programming, Novel Parallel Architectures and Cloud
Computing.
